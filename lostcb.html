      <p>There are several places to look if you've lost you chromebook. There is no "Find my Chromebook" feature that can shortcut an old-fashioned search. Here is a list of places we think you should check, in order:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Under your bed/ couch/ desk.</li>
          <li>In your old backpack (if you've just switched to a new one).</li>
          <li>In your classroom(s). Most of the time, if a student leaves their chromebook in a classroom, the teacher holds onto it for them.</li>
          <li>If a chromebook is lost in a common area of the High School, it may end up in the Tech Squad room.</li>
      </ol>
