      <h3>Get your Chromebook to the Tech Squad at the ChromeStore or via your Building Point Person.</h3>
      <p>The student-run Tech Squad is your first line of defense.</p>
      <p>They are in the ChromeStore outside the HS cafeteria, nearly all periods.</p>
      <p>If you learn at anywhere else, your Building Point Person can work directly with you.</p>
      <p>This website can also help you self-diagnose any problems, and work toward possible solutions.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>If you like, you can print the issue ticket below to fill out and bring to the ChromeStore or Building Point Person.</p>
