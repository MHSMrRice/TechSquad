    WiFi troubles?

  <div class="container">
    <h3>Head to an area with public WiFi.</h3>
    <p>Once the Chromebook connects there, it will fetch all the authetication certification needed for device WiFi across the district.</p>
    <p>If that didnt work you can always try to reset your chromebook...</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The first line of defense is to take your Chromebook to the student run Tech Squad, in the ChromeStore outside the High School Cafeteria.</p>
    <p>You may also use this resource to have a better idea about what your problem may be, and possible solutions.</p>
